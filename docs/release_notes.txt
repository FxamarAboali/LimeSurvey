=== UPGRADING=====

We suggest to check out and hold close to the instructions, which can be found in our online manual:
http://docs.limesurvey.org/tiki-index.php?page=Upgrading+from+a+previous+version
 

HOW TO UPGRADE from earlier versions of LimeSurvey (<=1.08)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Since the data structure and a lot of other things were changed, upgrading from any version previous to v1.50 is NOT possible. 
If you have old survey structure files with a *.sql extension the only way to get these into a newer version is to install version 1.50, import the .sql file(s) there, then upgrade that version to the most recent LimeSurvey version. 


HOW TO UPGRADE from LimeSurvey 1.50 or later (<=1.70)
------------------------------------------------------
1. Make backups of your files and database. REALLY, create backups FIRST!
3. Delete all old files 
4. Upload the new version to the same place.
6. Run the installer by visiting http://<yourdomain>/<yourlimesurveypath>/admin and follow the instructions
7. Restore any customized templates from your backup to /upload/templates (old version older than 1.70 either from /templates or from /upload/templates (>1.70)). You might have to adjust your templates since the CSS/structure might been changed since. 
   It is usually easier to customize a default templates, again, instead of fixing your old template! 
8. Done.

TEMPLATE modification between LimeSurvey 1.8
------------------------------------------------------
LimeSurvey 2 use a new placeholder for javascript inclusion: {TEMPLATEJS}.
Old template can be incompatible with the new javascript inclusion system. LimeSurvey need a placeholder to include js file for public survey.
The update process and the template upload process try to update your template. If there are javascript issue with your custom template, control you have the placeholder {TEMPLACEJS} in your starpage.pstpl.

Thank you to everyone who helped with this new release!
